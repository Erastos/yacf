* Features
** Process
- [X] Create Process
  - Keep process running, do not suspend
    - When execv get executed, it completely replaces the current process image, so I will no longer have control over that process
- [X] Feed Process Input
  - Let's use pipes for now
  - If that doesn't work, switch to shared memory
- [X] Capture Output
- [ ] Fix Error Involving Processes grabbing their own output from the pipe
  - Locking the files might work
    - Wrapping all of the functions in locks did not work, so need to move the locks
      - Look read pipe when writing too the application, and only unlock it when it is time to read from the application, and then lock it again
    - If this doesn't work, named pipes (FIFO) might be a solution
    - On a suggestion from a friend, use two pipes, one for reading from the process, and another for writing to the process
- [ ] Make into a library
  - Generate python bindings using tool
- [ ] Use Better Error Handling
  - Forward errors to python
